## Start your own blog

Clone this repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:bernardopacheco/bernardopacheco.github.io.git
```

Install the dependencies:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

Run the command:

```
docker-compose up
```

Done. Now you can open your browser and access the site locally at http://0.0.0.0:4000. Any blog's content change will be automatically reflected in the browser. No need to refresh!

To customize the blog with your own information, just update two files: [_config.yml](https://github.com/bernardopacheco/bernardopacheco.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml) and [src/css/variables.less](https://github.com/bernardopacheco/bernardopacheco.github.io/blob/master/src/css/variables.less).

The properties are self-explanatory. With these pieces of information, the site structure is generated, including:

- Site's source code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images and fonts);
- Social share buttons (Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn);
- Posts pagination;
- GitHub links;
- GitHub repository status (stars and forks);
- Disqus widget;
- Disqus latest comments;
- Font size, Font family and Material Design color palette.

Enjoy!
